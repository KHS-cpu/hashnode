In this lab, there are two VPCs. VPC 1 and VPC 2. VPC 1 has one EC2 connected to public subnet. VPC 2 had one EC2 connected to private subnet. These two VPCs will be connected via VPC peering.

The end result will be look like this. From EC2 1 public IP address should be able to ping to private IP address of EC2 2.

This is the Project VPC with CIDR range of 10.0.0.0/16

This is the test VPC with CIDR range of 172.16.0.0/16

In VPC peering I have connected two VPCs.

In Project VPC, I have config the route tables to test VPC using VPC peering connection.

In test VPCâ€™s private subnet, I have config the route tables to Project VPC using VPC peering connection.

I have used VPC Reachability Analyzer to have connectivity from Instance to Instance.

Note. You have to include ICMP in security group to be able to ping. Or use telnet.

If there are many VPC that needed to be connected we use Transit Gateway instead of VPC Peering.
